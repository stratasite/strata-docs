# Date and DateTime Dimensions

Use `date` and `date_time` dimensions for time-based grouping and filtering.

## Overview

- **`date`** — Date without time (e.g. order date, birth date). Format: YYYY-MM-DD.
- **`date_time`** — Timestamp with time (e.g. created_at, event time). Format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.

Define them as dimensions and set **grains** to control how users can group and filter.

## Grains

Grains are the granularities you allow for a date or date_time dimension.

```yaml
- type: dimension
  name: Order Date
  data_type: date
  grains:
    - day
    - week
    - month
    - quarter
    - year
  expression:
    sql: order_date
```

**Available grains:**

| Grain     | Typical use      | `date` | `date_time` |
|-----------|------------------|--------|-------------|
| `raw`     | Original value   | —      | ✓           |
| `second`  | Second-level    | —      | ✓           |
| `minute`  | Minute-level    | —      | ✓           |
| `hour`    | Hour-level      | —      | ✓           |
| `day`     | Day-level       | ✓      | ✓           |
| `week`    | Week-level      | ✓      | ✓           |
| `month`   | Month-level     | ✓      | ✓           |
| `quarter` | Quarter-level   | ✓      | ✓           |
| `year`    | Year-level      | ✓      | ✓           |

For `date_time`, you can include `raw`, `second`, `minute`, and `hour` when you need sub-day precision.

## Date Dimension Example

```yaml
- type: dimension
  name: Order Date
  description: Date when order was placed
  data_type: date
  grains:
    - day
    - week
    - month
    - quarter
    - year
  expression:
    sql: order_date
```

## DateTime Dimension Example

```yaml
- type: dimension
  name: Created At
  description: When the record was created
  data_type: date_time
  grains:
    - raw
    - hour
    - day
    - week
    - month
  expression:
    sql: created_at
```

## When to Use date vs date_time

- **`date`** — Order date, ship date, birth date, any dimension where time-of-day does not matter.
- **`date_time`** — Created at, updated at, event time, any dimension where hour/minute/second can be used for grouping or filtering.

## Formatting and Filtering

- Use [formatters](/semantic-model/fields/formatters) for display (e.g. locale-specific date formats).
- For high-cardinality timestamps, set `disable_value_listing: true` to avoid loading large value lists in filters.

## Best Practices

1. **Set grains** — Only include grains you need; they affect grouping and filtering.
2. **Prefer `date` when time is irrelevant** — Simpler and more efficient.
3. **Use `date_time` for events** — When users need hour or minute level.
4. **Disable value listing** for high-cardinality `date_time` dimensions.
