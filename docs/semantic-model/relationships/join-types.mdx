# Join Types

Specify join types for relationships.

## Overview

By default, relationships use INNER joins. You can specify different join types to handle optional relationships.

## Join Type Options

### inner (Default)

Returns only rows that match in both tables.

```yaml
orders_customer:
  left: Orders
  right: Customer
  join: inner  # Optional, this is the default
  sql: left.customer_id = right.id
  cardinality: many_to_one
```

**Use cases:**
- Required relationships
- Most common case
- Default if not specified

### left

Returns all rows from left table, NULLs for non-matching right rows.

```yaml
store_returns_reason:
  left: Store Returns
  right: Reason
  join: left
  sql: left.sr_reason_sk = right.r_reason_sk
  cardinality: many_to_one
```

**Use cases:**
- Optional relationships
- Nullable foreign keys
- When right table may not exist

### right

Returns all rows from right table, NULLs for non-matching left rows.

```yaml
products_categories:
  left: Products
  right: Categories
  join: right
  sql: left.category_id = right.id
  cardinality: many_to_one
```

**Use cases:**
- Less common
- When you want all categories, even without products

:::note Full Outer Join Not Supported
Strata does not support `full` (FULL OUTER) joins. If you need all rows from both tables regardless of match, consider:
- Using two separate LEFT joins and combining results
- Restructuring your model to avoid the need for full outer joins

## Common Patterns

### Required Relationship (INNER)

```yaml
sales_customer:
  left: Sales
  right: Customer
  sql: left.customer_id = right.id
  cardinality: many_to_one
  # join: inner (default, not needed)
```

### Optional Relationship (LEFT)

```yaml
orders_promotion:
  left: Orders
  right: Promotion
  join: left
  sql: left.promotion_id = right.id
  cardinality: many_to_one
```

**Why LEFT?** Not all orders have promotions, but we want all orders.

## Best Practices

1. **Use INNER by default** - Most relationships are required
2. **Use LEFT for optional** - When right table may not have matches
3. **Use RIGHT sparingly** - Less common, can be confusing
4. **Document join types** - Add comments explaining why
