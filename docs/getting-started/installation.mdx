# Installation

Before you can start using Strata CLI, you need to install it on your system. This guide will walk you through the installation process.

## Requirements

Before installing Strata CLI, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)**: 3.4.4 or higher
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**: 2.7.0 or higher (required for deployment features)

## Install Strata CLI

This installs Strata CLI globally on your system, so you can run `strata` commands from any directory.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="gem" label="Gem" default>
    ```bash
    gem install strata-cli
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="script" label="Shell Script">
    ```bash
    # Shell script installation coming soon
    # This method will allow installation without RubyGems
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify that Strata CLI is installed correctly:

```bash
strata version
```

This command displays the installed version of Strata CLI.

## Getting Help

To see all available commands, run:

```bash
strata
```

For detailed help on any command, use:

```bash
strata COMMAND --help
```

The CLI help system provides comprehensive documentation for each command, including options, examples, and usage patterns.

## Next Steps

Now that you have Strata CLI installed, you're ready to start creating your first Strata project!
