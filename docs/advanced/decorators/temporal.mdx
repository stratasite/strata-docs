# Temporal Decorators

Time-based calculations (YoY, MoM, etc.).

## Overview

Temporal decorators enable time-based comparisons like year-over-year (YoY), month-over-month (MoM), and other temporal calculations.

## Available Decorators

### Year-over-Year (YoY)

Compare to same period last year.

```yaml
# Applied in query, not in model definition
# User selects "YoY" decorator in UI
```

### Month-over-Month (MoM)

Compare to previous month.

```yaml
# Applied in query, not in model definition
```

### Period-over-Period

Compare to previous period (day, week, month, quarter, year).

## How It Works

Temporal decorators are applied at query time:
1. User selects measure and temporal decorator
2. Planner generates SQL with temporal calculation
3. Returns comparison values

## Use Cases

### Revenue Growth

```yaml
# Measure definition
- type: measure
  name: Total Revenue
  data_type: decimal
  expression:
    sql: sum(amount)

# User applies "YoY" decorator in query
# Returns: Current year revenue vs. last year revenue
```

### Month-over-Month Growth

```yaml
# User applies "MoM" decorator
# Returns: Current month vs. previous month
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use with date dimensions** - Temporal decorators require date dimensions
2. **Document measures** - Help users understand what can be compared
3. **Test calculations** - Verify temporal comparisons work correctly
