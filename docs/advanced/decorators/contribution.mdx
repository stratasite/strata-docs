# Contribution Decorators

Percentage of total calculations.

## Overview

Contribution decorators calculate what percentage each value represents of the total.

## Available Decorators

### Percentage of Total

Calculate percentage each value represents of total.

```yaml
# Applied in query, not in model definition
# User selects "Percentage of Total" decorator
```

## How It Works

Contribution decorators are applied at query time:
1. User selects measure and contribution decorator
2. Planner generates SQL with percentage calculation
3. Returns percentage values (0-100%)

## Use Cases

### Revenue Contribution

```yaml
- type: measure
  name: Revenue
  data_type: decimal
  expression:
    sql: sum(amount)

# User applies "Percentage of Total" decorator
# Returns: Each product's revenue as % of total revenue
```

### Market Share

```yaml
# User applies contribution decorator
# Returns: Each region's sales as % of total sales
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use with dimensions** - Contribution requires grouping by dimension
2. **Format as percentage** - Use `formatter: percent` for measures
3. **Document measures** - Help users understand contribution options
