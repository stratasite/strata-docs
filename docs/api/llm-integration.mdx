# Using AI with Strata

How to use AI coding assistants to build semantic models with Strata.

:::tip Key Point
**Strata does not require custom prompts or fine-tuning.**
Any modern AI coding agent (Cursor, Claude, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) can work with Strata by loading its official documentation.
:::

## What AI-First Means

Strata is designed to be AI-first. This means:

- AI agents can **understand** Strata's semantic modeling concepts
- AI agents can **generate** valid YAML configuration files
- AI agents can **follow** Strata's modeling rules and constraints
- No special prompts, private instructions, or fine-tuning required

When you work with an AI assistant on Strata projects, the AI isn't guessing — it's following documented rules and validated schemas.

## How AI Agents Understand Strata

Strata provides three machine-readable artifacts that AI agents use:

### 1. Canonical Documentation

Strata maintains a single, authoritative documentation export designed specifically for AI agents.

- Contains all concepts, rules, and constraints
- Includes canonical YAML examples for every file type
- Lists common mistakes to avoid
- Self-contained — AI loads it once and has complete context

### 2. Discovery Index

A machine-readable registry that helps AI agents understand what Strata can do.

- Lists all semantic object types (tables, relations, etc.)
- Maps each type to its validation schema
- Documents available CLI commands
- Summarizes critical constraints

### 3. Validation Schemas

JSON Schema definitions for every Strata YAML file type.

- Enables YAML validation before deployment
- Powers IDE autocomplete
- Prevents invalid configurations
- Defines required vs optional fields

## How to Work with AI Agents

When using an AI coding assistant with Strata, we recommend explicitly telling it:

1. That you are using Strata
2. That Strata has official documentation and rules
3. What you want to accomplish

Here are copy-paste instructions you can give your AI:

### Generating a New Semantic Model

```
We are using Strata for semantic modeling.
Please follow Strata's official semantic modeling rules and YAML format.

Generate a semantic model for the following database tables:
- orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount)
- customers (customer_id, name, email, created_at)
- products (product_id, name, category, price)
```

### Working with Existing Models

```
We are using Strata.
Here is an existing semantic model. Please review it and:
- Verify the relationship cardinalities are correct
- Optimize the cost configuration
- Ensure field names are unique and descriptive

[paste your YAML here]
```

### Learning Strata Concepts

```
We are using Strata for semantic modeling.
Please explain how relationships work in Strata, including:
- The difference between many_to_one and one_to_many
- How to handle many-to-many relationships
- When to use allow_measure_expansion
```

### Schema-First Generation

```
We are using Strata.
Please refer to Strata's documentation to understand how tables and relations are defined.

Generate a valid Strata table YAML for the following database schema:
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2)
);
```

## Recommended Workflows

### Workflow A: Generate Semantic Models

1. **Describe** your source database tables to the AI
2. **Ask** the agent to generate Strata YAML following official rules
3. **Review** the generated YAML for accuracy
4. **Validate** with `strata audit`
5. **Commit** and deploy

### Workflow B: Refactor Existing Models

1. **Provide** your existing YAML files to the AI
2. **Ask** for specific improvements (cost optimization, relationship fixes, naming)
3. **Review** the suggested changes
4. **Validate** with `strata audit`
5. **Test** before deploying to production

### Workflow C: Learn Strata Concepts

1. **Ask** conceptual questions about semantic modeling
2. **Request** examples for specific patterns
3. **Iterate** on your understanding
4. **Apply** what you learn to your models

---

## What NOT to Do

To get the best results from AI assistance, avoid these common mistakes:

### Do NOT invent YAML keys
Strata has a defined schema. Don't let AI create fields like `custom_aggregation` or `special_join` that don't exist.

### Do NOT assume SQL = semantic model
A SQL query is not a semantic model. Semantic models define reusable dimensions and measures, not ad-hoc queries.

### Do NOT create many_to_many relationships
Strata does not support `many_to_many` cardinality. Use junction tables with two separate relationships instead.

### Do NOT skip validation
Always run `strata audit` before deploying. AI-generated YAML should pass validation.

### Do NOT duplicate field names
Field names must be unique across your entire semantic layer. If AI creates duplicate names, ask it to make them unique.

### Do NOT bypass the rules
If AI suggests something that conflicts with Strata's rules, the rules win. Ask AI to find a compliant approach.

## Where AI Documentation Lives

For tool builders and advanced users, here's where the machine-readable artifacts are located:

| Artifact | URL | Purpose |
|----------|-----|---------|
| Full Documentation | `/llms.txt` | Complete knowledge for AI agents |
| Discovery Index | `/api/docs.json` | Schema registry and CLI commands |
| Validation Schemas | `/api/schema/*.json` | YAML structure validation |

**Note:** This page explains how to use AI with Strata. The artifacts above are what AI agents actually consume.

## Summary

Working with AI on Strata projects is straightforward:

1. **Tell** your AI you're using Strata
2. **Describe** what you want to build
3. **Review** the generated YAML
4. **Validate** with `strata audit`
5. **Deploy** with confidence

Strata's AI-first design means you don't need prompt engineering tricks. Just clear instructions and validation.
